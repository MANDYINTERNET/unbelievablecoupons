		first time i saw people i don't live with since like christmas? we all kinda just shared traumas with each other. these days are not kind on those with desire in their hearts. lost my last website. i forgot about my old email account that it was registered to and forgot i had to manually renew each year. some squatter snatched it up real quick. found out when i tried bringing up the site on the demo computers at target. it's okay. wasn't really feeling it anymore. i'll get some snazzy new domain for this html file. it'll be cool. i'm internet, baby.
