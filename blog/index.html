	wiped the blog. yep, yep, yep. used it to vent too much. been Doin' Things lately. up and up, and all that. couple months of bleh out the way, it's time for spring, it's time for art! i just finished a 4 hour art session where i made a couple panels for a story that came to me in a shower about a sleep study institute. there's not a lot to it but i'm very happy with what i got done! i did it during the airing of The Oscars, inspired by Joel Haver's "make a movie instead of watching the oscars" thing. oh yeah there's also a page for some demo pages of a surreal zine i want to make. i imagine a lot of pages on this site will lead to demos, and i like the idea of that. have lots of things i can chip away at when my fancy doth motivate me. or just keep trying new things until one sticks. yeah. here's to spring. cheers.
