	WHAT'S NEW WITH MANDY? I hear you asking, nay, demanding, from your digital device to mine. I hear you, and I respect you, so I shall give you what you want.
	<br>
	Okay actually though I kinda just forgot about the blog. Mayyy have remembered about it because I keep telling people about this site and had a "oh yeah I need to do some updates" moment.
	<br>
	Between the last post and now I had a long videos game binge from like, end of that vacation to mid May. Not proud of it, but someone has to make those digital numbers go up and collect cool hats (no one actually has to do this, in fact there should probably be less people doing this).
	<br>
	I've been conquering trail after trail with a friend, I should probably have a sight-seeing coupon or something where I can organize pictures and document our weird findings when out and about.
	<br>
	There haven't been many drawings lately, buuuut... FISHBALL2 is once again back in full development! Only forgot about that game for uh... 8 months. Making strides with it though! At some point I will throw a tiny demo + screenshots onto a page, still a little early for that, though.
	<br>
	Oh yeah, I made some new friends recently, one of wh

	the vacation was good. went to some vintage toy shops, walked around boardwalks, paid way too much for food. some friends stopped by for a day, and we had a bartender night and a chef night. both were a great deal of fun.
	<br>
	most imporantly we discovered TRUE SPEED. for some reason they had a hoverboard (the 2-wheel segway type things you balance on) with a conversion kit that turned it into a go-kart of sorts. a hoverkart. we raced a lap around the golf course every night we were there. i currently hold the lap time record of 3:02.30.
	<br>
	i didn't take many photos but i did get some good ones. also filmed a silly video on an impulse, inpsired by porpentine's vids. more of those to come.
	<br>
	i read frog k's "metamour experience" while i was out, great collection of short stories, highly recommend. maybe i should make coupons linking to others' works of art i like. hmmm.
	<br>
	doin some small tweaks to the site right now, more to come.
	<br>
	<br>
	<h3>20220413</h3>
	another week of drawings complete, these were all available exclusively on site! not all of them are very high effort, but some of them are some of my favorite works so far! i'm noticing that my output is getting quicker and i'm getting more consistent with my style. also learning lots of little new techniques as i go along. it's a satisfying progression.
	<br>
	my monitor's still fucked, however i now have a serviceable replacement with good colors and viewing angles. my phone screen is starting to die, it's doing some weird horizontal banding thing now. car still needs fixing.
	<br>
	i'm about to go to da beach for a few days with some friends though, so fuck all that stress. i probably won't be making any art while i'm there. maybe some sketches. i'll at least try to take some weird photos. hopefully my ravenous fanbase can do without coupons for a few days.
	<br>
	mandy over and out.
	<br>

	<h3>20220407</h3>
	my really nice monitor died last night. just went from on to acting as if it was unplugged. tried a different cable, nothin. it's really upsetting because when i built my pc 7 years ago i splurged on a monitor with the idea that it'd be pretty future-proofed and would last through a couple rebuilds. yet somehow it is the only part from my build to have failed to date. i'm really really really hoping it's fixable and that it's something minor like the power switch failing. stuck with a backup that makes everything really blue until i can get this figured out. 
	<br>
	ugh and i've also gotta get my car fixed. and my headphones. so much shit just breaking.
	<br>
	i should probably make some backups of my pc before other things start going.
	<br>
	god if shit is gonna cost so much money why the fuck is everything seemingly disposable too. sorry. ranting.
	<br>
	<br>
	<h3>20220405</h3>
	it's been a week of a drawing a day now. it's been giving me some structure to my day which is nice and i've surprised myself by how i can just. keep drawing. for hours. and not lose focus. it's nice. 
	<br>
	not sure if i'm going to bother with continuing to post them on the twitter. seems to be a bad place for art, especially for art as inconsistent and amateur as mine. i tried to bump my posts by posting something low effort before or after a new drawing but all that happens is the low effort stuff gets attention. this is probably a bad mindset to be developing so yeah. no more twitter i think.
	<br>
	for this next week i'll do daily updates here. i'll add a new link to the homepage for it tomorrow.
	<br>
	<br>
	<h3>20220401</h3>
	happy april all. i've been doing a drawing a day for the last 4 days now and i'm gonna see how long i can keep it up. i'm wondering if i should put those in daily blog updates or save them for a big picture pack coupon? email me if you wish to have influence upon my life on that matter. i do post them to my twitter, which exists really just for art. 
	<br>
	<a href="https://twitter.com/MANDYINTERNET/">@MANDYINTERNET</a>
	<br>
	there's actually a decent bit of art on there that i intend to work into things on the site or whatever so yeah go check that out if that sounds interesting. hit like on my poasts, hit the "Re Tweete" and do a lil commentary boost my engagement give me validation make me Feel That Dopamine. ok thank you.
	<br>
	<br>
	<h3>20220330</h3>
	finally getting over this dang ol cold. it kicked in the night i made my last blog post. at this point im just congested and phlegmy. eugh. uh. yeah, that's it.
	<br>
	<br>
	<h3>20220328</h3>
	wiped the blog. yep, yep, yep. used it to vent too much. been Doin' Things lately. up and up, and all that. couple months of bleh out the way, it's time for spring, it's time for art! i just finished a 4 hour art session where i made a couple panels for a story that came to me in a shower about a sleep study institute. there's not a lot to it but i'm very happy with what i got done! i did it during the airing of The Oscars, inspired by Joel Haver's "make a movie instead of watching the oscars" thing. oh yeah there's also a page for some demo pages of a surreal zine i want to make. i imagine a lot of pages on this site will lead to demos, and i like the idea of that. have lots of things i can chip away at when my fancy doth motivate me. or just keep trying new things until one sticks. yeah. here's to spring. cheers.
