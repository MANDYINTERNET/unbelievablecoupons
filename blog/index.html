	ok so the last 4 days where have they gone. hmm. kinda had an extended anxiety attack i think. sleeping anywhere from 2-12 hours at a time, up for 4-20 hours. just complete consciousness chaos. i really did not want to interact with people. 
	<br>
	<br>
	been playing the new path of exile league. that's a game i have many thoughts and feelings about, but to keep it brief: the latest expansion is quite good and the revamped endgame fixes a lot of problems i've had with the game in the past. i have played an unhealthy amount during my recent anxiety and will continue to play it until i at least get to the new boss battles.
	<br>
	<br>
	finally got to hang out with a friend i haven't seen since the start of my, let's call it "seasonal", depression. felt very good and i feel like i'm over my last few days anxiety. was worried i was beginning to develop agoraphobia but i'm good now. we did a classic "walk around the mall for hours". like i detailed in my <b>20220127</b> post, malls are strange places. we really just took the piss out of every store we wandered into and caused a general ruckus, felt good to let loose and be wacky in public.
	<br>
	<br>
	the weirdest store though has got to be sephora. i've never been in a sephora before. i've never had a desire to go into a sephora before. but i have been cursed with a sephora gift card, so into sephora i went. i've been to other beauty/makeup stores before and they are generally chill even with the whole unrealistic body image shit going on. products are generally organized together in groups that make for easy browsing. not sephora. no no no not sephora. this is the <i>designer</i> makeup store. everything is organized by <i>brand</i>. every shelf has pictures of impossible women and phrases like <b>plump</b>, <b>lucious</b>, <b>irresistable</b> repeated like mantras. it's an assault on the senses and the ego. i felt attacked by these inanimate objects with their ludicrous price tags. it was even further disturbing to see young girls running around the place looking at products like this is all some fun playtime game and not <i>gestures vaguely</i> whatever the hell kind of capitalist dehumanizing hellscape this is. eugh.
	<br>
	<br>
	oh yeah i saw some kittens guinea pigs at a pet shelter in the mall. damn i want a guinea pig. pathetic little creatures. wheek wheek.
	<br>

	sometimes i get paranoid that maybe i have caught covid from hanging out with people or from my parents (heard my dad cough like once yesterday and was on alert for a bit) but all i have to do to quell those fears is pick up my cat and for a moment his horrid breath is the sweetest scent. i really love this orange goofball but why is he so stinky. why.

	uhm. where has the time gone. i don't like this. i went to a party and got way too drunk, vomited at the end, suffered a hangover the next day.
	<br>
	my connections with others feel hollow. i wish i didn't have to be involved in others' lives. i don't like that i have influence within this material plane. it's so much easier to just let time drift on by and subsist. not worry about others, not worry about others worrying about me. 
	<br>
	interaction on the computer is so much more natural. safe. sensical. must be all the microplastic i consume. i have all my little interests here to entertain me for eternity.
	<br>
	i truly hate this push and pull. computer being my only outlet driving me insane. then the pendulum swings and now i don't want to leave my room for anything anymore.
	<br>
	i do wish that it was *my* room, though. if i had my own place, i could so peacefully snuggle in to a hermit's life interspersed with bits of explosive social energy.

	i wonder if anyone sees this website that's not like, the usual people i talk to. hello? are you that? my email link is right up there.

	i swear my local mall is some kind of shifting labyrinth. there are so many new or different stores from when i was there last month. i guess this is evidence that the mall is in fact a healthy living organism and not dying like most are... still feels weird. i walk around there in amazement, a new bit of architecture, a new potted plant, a hallway that was once dim now with new lights, a store selling overpriced junk that will without a doubt be gone within five years. i must weird mall workers out. even mall goers. just basking in the sights and sounds like i just got freed from a cave after a decade. i will at some point take this weirdness to the next level and film or photograph many things there and probably get in trouble in the process. some day...

	was up late last night, hanging out then having more troubled sleep. this morning i cleaned my keyboard out for the first time since i got it years ago. it wasn't nearly as gross as i was expecting, but the keys had begun to have issues being pressed. all is smooth once again. cleaned my entire room while i was at it too. coupon time babey.
	<h4>p2</h4>
	oh yeah, i have received my second email. its contents will be the inspiration of a future coupon for sure... who doesn't love a little fursuit transformation art?
	<br>

	<h3>20220125</h3>
	pretty sure i suffered a food poisoning last night and most of today. couldn't sleep well, spent the morning hours lying around or in the bathroom. bleh. overall just out of it. coupon ideas floating in my head. will make some later tonight. lesson to be learned dear reader: if you're told a sauce is forbidden; it may be for good reason...

	no new entry or coupon yesterday, ended up being busy from bedleave to bedenter. woke up, got brunch with my friend, had mimosas :P we hung out all day.
	<br>
	<br>
	played Yuki on his vr system and i think this is my favorite vr game. it's a bullet-hell and your character is a little action figure you hold in one hand, so you can make really precise movements around obstacles and through waves of enemy shots, only moving your entire body to get around the largest obstacles. i was getting pretty good in the few rounds i played. damn i want vr... 
	<br>
	<br>
	we met up with another friend and went to a nearby sushi place. it was my first time going there and the atmosphere was really comfy, low lighting, chill electronic music playing quietly, not many people there. got spicy salmon, tuna, and peanut avacado rolls and a nice drink. 
	<br>
	<br>
	we capped the day off with another friend and mario party. i made a make-or-break wager on a duel minigame near the start of the game and was designated 4th place loser from there on out so my mission was to sow chaos and chaos did i sow. moving the star, using custom dice to land on chance times and bowser spaces. on the very finaly turn of the game i land on boo and actually have enough money to steal a star. if i steal from the first place player, second will probably win. or i can steal from the player i suspect will get the bonus stars. i chant CHAOS CHAOS CHAOS and let the game choose for me. i earn my first star stealing from third place, sealing the victory for first. mario party is great.
	<br>
	<br>
	was a wonderful day. reminds me of old times. there is a lingering shadow of "oh god am i gonna get covid" whenever i see people now, though.
	<br>
	alright, more coupons coming for all you savings freaks.

	first time i saw people i don't live with since like christmas? we all kinda just shared traumas with each other. these days are not kind on those with desire in their hearts. lost my last website. i forgot about my old email account that it was registered to and forgot i had to manually renew each year. some squatter snatched it up real quick. found out when i tried bringing up the site on the demo computers at target. it's okay. wasn't really feeling it anymore. i'll get some snazzy new domain for this html file. it'll be cool. i'm internet, baby.
	<h4>p2</h4>
	finally settled on a url that tickles my fancy. i've got big plans for the homepage. will host this blog somewhere else on the site later. for now this is what you get. seriously though look at that url. that's hilarious.

	received my first email today, it reads "Pee" and nothing more.
