	no new entry or coupon yesterday, ended up being busy from bedleave to bedenter. woke up, got brunch with my friend, had mimosas :P we hung out all day.
	<br>
	<br>
	played Yuki on his vr system and i think this is my favorite vr game. it's a bullet-hell and your character is a little action figure you hold in one hand, so you can make really precise movements around obstacles and through waves of enemy shots, only moving your entire body to get around the largest obstacles. i was getting pretty good in the few rounds i played. damn i want vr...

	we met up with another friend and went to a nearby sushi place. it was my first time going there and the atmosphere was really comfy, low lighting, chill electronic music playing quietly, not many people there. got spicy salmon, tuna, and peanut avacado rolls and a nice drink. 
	<br>
	<br>
	we capped the day off with another friend and mario party. i made a make-or-break wager on a duel minigame near the start of the game and was designated 4th place loser from there on out so my mission was to sow chaos and chaos did i sow. moving the star, using custom dice to land on chance times and bowser spaces. on the very finaly turn of the game i land on boo and actually have enough money to steal a star. if i steal from the first place player, second will probably win. or i can steal from the player i suspect will get the bonus stars. i chant CHAOS CHAOS CHAOS and let the game choose for me. i earn my first star stealing from third place, sealing the victory for first. mario party is great.

	was a wonderful day. reminds me of old times. there is a lingering shadow of "oh god am i gonna get covid" whenever i see people now, though.
	<br>
	alright, more coupons coming for all you savings freaks.

	first time i saw people i don't live with since like christmas? we all kinda just shared traumas with each other. these days are not kind on those with desire in their hearts. lost my last website. i forgot about my old email account that it was registered to and forgot i had to manually renew each year. some squatter snatched it up real quick. found out when i tried bringing up the site on the demo computers at target. it's okay. wasn't really feeling it anymore. i'll get some snazzy new domain for this html file. it'll be cool. i'm internet, baby.
	<h4>p2</h4>
	finally settled on a url that tickles my fancy. i've got big plans for the homepage. will host this blog somewhere else on the site later. for now this is what you get. seriously though look at that url. that's hilarious.
	<h4>p3</h4>
	received my first email today, it reads "Pee" and nothing more.
	<h4>p4</h4>
	we've got our first coupon! which you had to click past to get here. good job. clicking is an important skill to develop.
